### About Me

I am currently a senior undergraduate student in the Department of Physics at Ewha Womans University. I am majoring in physics and minoring in mathematics and philosophy.

My research interests lie in astrophysics, particularly gravitational waves, multi-messenger astronomy, and artificial intelligence. Recently, I have developed a strong interest in **astroinformatics**—the integration of astronomy and data science to gain new insights from gravitational wave observatory data.

### Hobbies

I enjoy reading books from a wide range of fields, especially in the natural sciences. I also love watching musicals, listening to music, drawing, and creating videos.

You can watch some educational videos I’ve uploaded on my YouTube channel, [@mulli_babo](https://www.youtube.com/@mulli_babo).
