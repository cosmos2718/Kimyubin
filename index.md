## Welcome to Yubin Kim's Page

I am currently a senior undergraduate student in the Department of Physics at Ewha Womans University. I am majoring in physics and minoring in mathematics and philosophy.

My research interests lie in astrophysics, particularly gravitational waves, multi-messenger astronomy, and artificial intelligence. Recently, I have developed a strong interest in astroinformaticsâ€”the integration of astronomy and data science to gain new insights from gravitational wave observatory data.
